### **Curriculum Vitae Website**
Project Goals
The aim of this project is to design and develop a single-page website to showcase my Curriculum Vitae. This site includes information about my skills, experience, and education, while also serving as a portfolio with links to relevant projects. The goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly platform for potential employers or collaborators to learn more about my professional background.

### **Project Analysis**
User Profile
The target audience for this website includes recruiters, potential employers, and collaborators in the tech and creative industries. The typical user is someone who is looking to learn more about my professional background, work experience, and skill set. They are likely to be interested in a clear, concise presentation of information, with easy navigation and quick access to contact details.

### **Information Architecture**
The website is structured as a single-page application to ensure a smooth and straightforward user experience. It is divided into the following sections:

### Header:
Includes a profile picture, my name, and a brief introduction.
Personal Information: Provides essential contact details like email, phone, and location.
Work Experience: Lists my previous jobs and internships, detailing the roles and durations.
Skills: Highlights my key competencies, such as proficiency with software and video editing.

By organizing the content into distinct sections, users can easily navigate and find the information they need.

### **Visual Design**
The website's visual design focuses on simplicity and readability. The color palette includes shades of green and blue to convey professionalism and trust. The primary colors are:

Green (#1e9b24, #45c96d): Used for headers and emphasis to create a fresh, modern look.
Blue (#8fa9e4): Used for accents like borders and links to draw attention without overwhelming.
Neutral tones (#f9f9f9, #333): Provide a clean background and readable text.
The typography is kept simple with Arial, ensuring clarity across different devices. The layout is responsive, designed to work well on desktop screens with plans for future enhancements to mobile compatibility.

### **Design Proposal**
The initial design was prototyped using Figma, where I explored different layouts, color schemes, and typography options. You can view the design prototype here.

### **Technologies Used**
